    $ gimme foo bar baz

Runs
    goal=foo ./foo.maker tmpdest  # for a fresh tmpdest filename
and expects either
    $? is 0 and tmpdest exists: Rename tmpdest to foo.
or
    $? is 137 and foo exists:   Do nothing.
else:
    Exit with 1.
And likewise for bar and baz.

Now exit with 137 if goal was set at entry and the goal file exists
and is younger than any of foo, bar, baz; else exit with 0.

The purpose of all this: foo.maker should work like

    #!/bin/sh
    set -e
    gimme this that the-other
    make-foo this that the-other >$1

so that, at top level,

    $ gimme foo

runs make-foo and mv's the result to foo, but only if foo is stale
after recursively gimme-ing this, that, and the-other.
