Idea: nicer hand-coding of finite-state recognizers in C.

Sketch in sketch.c.

Inspired by psnoise.c [*], and before that by wanting a task to
drive-test my crusoe-parsing ideas on.

Task to drive further development, supposing it ever happens: a
Postscript lexer or lexical-syntax checker.
See js-postscript/PLRM2.pdf for spec.
