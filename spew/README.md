A port of the Lisp code from D. Hofstadter, "Lisp: Lists and
Recursion" in _Metamagical Themas_. [menu.text](menu.text) is copied
from there (with a change of format).

(Trivial note: the acronyms in menu.text are messed up with
"particularly" in place of e-words, presumably "especially"; I wonder
if the _Scientific American_ editors did that.)

An example of how to run it:

    $ python spew.py 'lamb chops'
    lamb chops (including noodles), got usually in northern Italy and shad
    and unusual coffee (eccellente!) and green and red lasagne in cheddar,
    havarti, Emmentaler (particularly strong, hearty, and rather pungent
    Emmentaler) (noodles (oodles of delicious lamb chops (including
    noodles (oodles of delicious linguini), elegantly served), got usually
    in northern Italy), elegantly served everywhere!) and meatballs,
    casually heaped onto pasta sauce
