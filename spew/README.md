A port of the Lisp code from D. Hofstadter, "Lisp: Lists and
Recursion" in _Metamagical Themas_. [menu.text](menu.text) is copied
from there (with a change of format).

An example of how to run it:

    $ python spew.py rhubarb
    rigatoni and vongole in oil, lavishly introduced heated under butter
    and ravioli heated under butter and ravioli heated under butter and
    rhubarb (belly all stuffed (tummy ache!)) (basta!) (basta!)
