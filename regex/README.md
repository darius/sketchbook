# Regular expression matching

A lot of messing around. See also ../lex and
https://github.com/darius/regexercise and
https://github.com/darius/regexercise_solutions

Not all of these work. I thought they did when I checked them in
(modulo some comments on limited applicability), but I went overboard
in trying for simpler more-elegant code. (E.g. the XXX in
nfa_simplest.py.)

TODO torture them all with a better test suite and try to rework a
simplest actually-good version from these explorations.
